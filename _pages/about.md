Hey, I am Sharaf and welcome to my website! 

I am chemical engineer turned roboticst, who is passionate about automonous systems, machine learning and solving real-world problems.

I build robotics and autonomy systems that have to work at the edge: high-speed AV racing, manipulation, and aerial autonomy. I care about tight perception-to-control latency, estimator robustness, and controller stability under real-world constraints.

Currently at UC Berkeley (ROAR Lab) with AI Racing Tech. I work across C++/Python/ROS 2, optimization, and systems design.

**Focus areas**
- High-speed vehicle dynamics, tire-model-aware control, and nonlinear MPC
- State estimation (EKF/UKF), sensor fusion, and fault handling
- Robotics infra: ROS 2, Isaac Sim, CI for autonomy stacks, and real-time tuning
