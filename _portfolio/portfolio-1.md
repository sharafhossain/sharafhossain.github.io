## Overview
This project is part of the **UC Berkeley ROAR (Robot Open Autonomous Racing) program**, where I work on autonomy and control for high-speed autonomous race cars in a competitive racing environment.

The goal is to design **robust, real-time control and decision-making algorithms** that operate at the limits of vehicle dynamics, under uncertainty, and with strict latency constraints.

This setting closely mirrors real-world autonomy challenges in **robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI**.

## Problem
Autonomous racing pushes autonomy systems beyond standard self-driving scenarios:
- Extreme speeds and accelerations
- Tight handling limits and tire saturation
- Rapidly changing dynamics
- Hard real-time constraints

Traditional rule-based control breaks down in these regimes. The system must reason about dynamics, constraints, and future outcomes **online**.

---

## Technical Focus
My work focuses on the **control and autonomy stack**, including:

- Vehicle dynamics modeling
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) for trajectory tracking and stabilization
- Constraint handling (tire limits, actuator bounds, safety margins)
- State estimation and feedback integration
- Interfaces between perception, planning, and control

Where relevant, learning-based components are explored to improve performance and adaptability.

## My Contributions
- Developed and tuned **MPC-based controllers** for high-speed autonomous driving
- Integrated vehicle dynamics models into real-time control loops
- Worked on control robustness near the handling limits
- Collaborated within a multi-disciplinary autonomy stack (planning, perception, systems)

## Tools & Stack
- Python, C++
- Control & optimization (MPC)
- Robotics middleware and simulation
- Vehicle dynamics modeling
- Data-driven analysis for controller evaluation

---

## Results
- Stable autonomous driving at racing speeds
- Reliable trajectory tracking under aggressive maneuvers
- Demonstrated performance in competitive autonomous racing settings

---

## Why This Matters
This project directly aligns with **robotics and autonomous systems roles** at companies like NVIDIA:
- Real-time decision-making under uncertainty
- Tight integration of control, optimization, and learning
- Safety-critical systems operating at scale and speed

It demonstrates my ability to **build, reason about, and deploy autonomy algorithms** in demanding real-world conditions.

## Next Steps
- Deeper integration of learning-based components with MPC
- Improved state estimation under sensor noise
- Scaling approaches to more complex multi-agent scenarios
